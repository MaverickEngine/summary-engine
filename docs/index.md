# Welcome to SummaryEngine

SummaryEngine is a Wordpress plugin that uses machine learning to help editors generate summaries to articles. It would typically be used in a newsroom, but can be used in other contexts too.

It uses the "human-in-the-loop" approach, where the editor is responsible for quality control, and can choose to accept, reject or edit the summary.
